# Codeless MVP - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Vision & Goals

### 1.1 Introduction
Codeless is an interactive, agent-assisted platform that guides non-technical individuals through the process of building simple web or mobile applications.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Many people have app ideas but lack the technical coding skills to build them. Traditional no-code/low-code tools can still have a steep learning curve.

### 1.3 Vision
To democratize app creation by providing an intelligent, conversational mentor that breaks down complex development tasks into understandable, actionable steps.

### 1.4 Target Audience
- Aspiring entrepreneurs with app ideas but no coding background
- Small business owners needing simple custom tools
- Hobbyists and students interested in learning basic app development concepts
- Individuals who find existing no-code platforms overwhelming

### 1.5 Core Goals for V1.0
- Users can successfully build a pre-defined simple application (e.g., a "To-Do List App") from start to a basic functional state
- The AI agent effectively breaks down the app-building process into manageable steps
- Users feel empowered and understand the basic logic of the app they've built

### 1.6 Key Differentiator
Instead of static tutorials or complex drag-and-drop interfaces alone, users interact with an AI agent that:
- Understands the user's goal (within the defined scope for V1.0)
- Asks clarifying questions
- Provides context-aware instructions
- Helps troubleshoot basic issues by interpreting user actions or inputs
- Adapts its guidance based on the current stage of app development

### 1.7 Success Metrics
- Completion rate for building the target V1.0 app
- Time taken to complete the guided app build
- User-reported understanding of the steps and concepts
- Positive feedback on the helpfulness and clarity of the AI agent

### 1.8 Out of Scope for V1.0
- Building highly complex or custom-logic applications
- Direct code editing or generation of complex code
- Deployment to app stores or custom domains
- Integration with external APIs or databases (beyond very basic, internal storage)
- Advanced UI customization beyond predefined templates/elements
- Multiple app types (focus on ONE simple archetype for V1.0)

## 2. Feature Specifications

### 2.1 Agent-Led Project Initialization

#### User Problem
"I want to build an app, but I don't know where to begin or how to set up the basic structure."

#### User Stories
1. "As a non-technical user, I want to tell the AI agent what kind of simple app I want to build, so it can prepare the right starting point."
2. "As a user, I want the AI agent to explain the basic components of the app we are about to build."
3. "As a user, I want the AI agent to automatically set up a basic project structure or template for the chosen app type."

#### Functional Requirements
- Input: User indicates they want to build the V1.0 target app (e.g., "To-Do List")
- AI Agent's Role:
  - Confirm the user's intent
  - Provide a brief, simple overview of the app's core features and purpose
  - Initiate the creation of a new project within the Codeless environment
  - Explain what the initial setup means in simple terms
- System Action: Create a new, blank, or minimally templated project

#### UI/UX Considerations
- Clear, conversational interface for interacting with the agent
- Visual confirmation that a new project has been started
- The AI agent's guidance should be prominent and easy to follow

### 2.2 Step-by-Step Guided UI & Logic Building

#### User Problem
"I see a blank canvas/builder, but I don't know how to add buttons, text fields, or make them do anything."

#### User Stories
1. "As a non-technical user, I want the AI agent to tell me exactly which UI element to add next and where to roughly place it."
2. "As a user, I want the AI agent to guide me in naming elements simply."
3. "As a user, I want the AI agent to explain, step-by-step, how to connect a button to an action."
4. "As a user, I want the AI to help me define where the list of tasks will be displayed."

#### Functional Requirements
- The AI agent breaks down the construction of each feature into discrete, sequential instructions
- AI Agent's Role:
  - Provide clear instructions for adding UI elements
  - Guide element naming and configuration
  - Explain simple logic connections
- Underlying App Builder Platform must provide:
  - A visual canvas
  - A toolbox of UI components
  - A way to define simple event-driven logic
  - A simple internal data store for the tasks

#### UI/UX Considerations
- The AI agent's instructions appear alongside or overlayed on the app-building interface
- Visual cues pointing to relevant UI elements or areas
- Clear indication of the current step and progress
- Simple language, avoiding technical jargon

### 2.3 Basic App Preview & Iteration Guidance

#### User Problem
"I want to see if what I've built actually works, and if not, I need help figuring out what's wrong."

#### User Stories
1. "As a user, I want the AI agent to tell me when it's a good time to preview the app I'm building."
2. "As a user, I want to easily switch to a 'preview' mode to test the functionality."
3. "As a user, if something doesn't work as expected, I want the AI agent to help me identify the likely issue."
4. "As a user, I want to be able to save my project."

#### Functional Requirements
- AI Agent's Role:
  - Prompt for preview at logical checkpoints
  - Provide basic troubleshooting guidance
- System Action:
  - "Preview" mode functionality
  - Mode switching capability
  - Project saving functionality

#### UI/UX Considerations
- Clear "Preview App" button
- Seamless transition between build and preview modes
- Contextual troubleshooting advice

# Build Agent Specification

## Purpose
Guide users step-by-step in building a basic to-do app.

## Capabilities
- Intent detection for user goals
- Instructional breakdown of UI element setup
- Step tracking and progress recall
- Contextual error handling and feedback

## Example Dialogue
User: "I want to build a to-do app."
Agent: "Great choice! We'll start with a task input. Find the 'Text Input' component and drag it into the canvas."
```
